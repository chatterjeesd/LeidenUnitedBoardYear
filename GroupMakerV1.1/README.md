# LeidenUnitedGroupMaker
As assessor internal, the program GroupMakerV1.1 was coded by me to automate the system of making groups of members of our student association (Leiden United) maintaining an approximately equal Dutch:international ratio, male:female ratio and according to their availability for dinners at other Dutch student associations. 

The program also gathers and arranges data from the signup forms and gives important statistics and information about choices and interests of every single member, potential group-leaders, payment statuses and other information which are useful in assigning Dutch-international "buddies".
